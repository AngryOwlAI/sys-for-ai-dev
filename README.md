# Sys4AI-dev

This repository is the development workspace for `Sys4AI`.

The project being developed lives in [`Sys4AI/`](Sys4AI/).

The current product-definition sources are:

- [`PRDs/Sys4AI_phase-0_product_system_design_prd.md`](PRDs/Sys4AI_phase-0_product_system_design_prd.md)
- [`PRDs/Sys4AI_phase-1_implementation_initialization_prd.md`](PRDs/Sys4AI_phase-1_implementation_initialization_prd.md)

The earlier Phase 0 draft remains available at
[`PRDs/Sys4AI_phase-0_prd.md`](PRDs/Sys4AI_phase-0_prd.md) as a
superseded historical reference.

Phase 1 implementation planning lives in
[`implementation_plans/`](implementation_plans/). The executable reference
scaffold, validators, registries, skill adapters, and documentation policies
live under [`Sys4AI/`](Sys4AI/).

Development-system runtime skills live under [`.agents/skills/`](.agents/skills/).
Thin Codex compatibility shims live under [`.codex/skills/`](.codex/skills/)
and point back to the `.agents` runtime surface. The `Sys4AI/skills/core/`
directory remains a product-scaffold reference surface, not the active
development-system runtime.

Validate the root skill layer with:

```bash
make validate-dev-skills
```

Validate the product scaffold with:

```bash
make validate-product-scaffold
```

Run both checks with:

```bash
make validate
```
