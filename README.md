# Sys4AI Development Repository

Sys4AI is a host-neutral framework product and meta-agent runtime for designing,
building, verifying, operating, improving, and retiring governed agentic
systems. This repository, Sys4AI-dev, is the development system used to build
that product. They are related, but they are not the same system.

The governing dependency rule is:

> Sys4AI-dev may depend on Sys4AI. Sys4AI must not depend on Sys4AI-dev.

## Sixty-second orientation

| Object | Meaning | Location |
|---|---|---|
| Development system (D) | Bootstrap agent, project authority, current work, tools, and evidence | repository root and `development/` |
| Host system (H) | Codex, CLI, CI, or another execution environment | adapters and host profiles |
| Sys4AI (M2) | Portable framework product and executable meta-agent runtime | `Sys4AI/` |
| Target framework (M1) | A governed framework produced for a class of targets | generated outside the product source |
| Target instance (M0) | A concrete agent, workflow, multi-agent system, or application | a target workspace |
| Reader/evidence surface (R) | Reports, logs, generated readers, and release evidence | `development/evidence/` or ignored runtime state |

Self-hosting means a trusted Sys4AI release may help produce a separate
candidate successor. It does not merge development authority, product
authority, target authority, or mutable runtime state.

## Current authority

Read these in order:

1. [PROJECT_STATUS.md](PROJECT_STATUS.md) — what is true now.
2. [Product baseline PRD](PRDs/active/Sys4AI_product_baseline_prd.md) — what
   Sys4AI must be.
3. [Repository reboot PRD](PRDs/active/Sys4AI_repository_reboot_prd.md) — the
   current approved change boundary.
4. [Active implementation plan](implementation_plans/active/repository-reboot-implementation-plan.md)
   — how the current change is being implemented and verified.
5. [Architecture index](architecture/README.md) and [decision index](decisions/README.md)
   — system structure and consequential decisions.

Generated documents, local caches, runtime logs, and memory indexes are
navigation or evidence. They are not requirement or approval authority.

## Repository map

- `PRDs/`: product and change requirements.
- `architecture/`: current system architecture and boundary models.
- `decisions/`: accepted architecture decision records.
- `implementation_plans/active/`: exactly one active implementation plan.
- `development/`: canonical bootstrap-development runtime, tools, state, and
  evidence.
- `.agents/` and `.codex/`: generated host bindings only.
- `Sys4AI/`: extractable, independently buildable product.
- `integration/`: target fixtures and cross-boundary tests.

See [SYSTEM_MAP.md](SYSTEM_MAP.md) for the dependency and authority flows.

## Validation

From the repository root:

    make validate-development
    make validate-product
    make validate-integration
    make validate

From inside `Sys4AI/`:

    make lint
    make test
    make validate-contracts
    make validate-assets
    make build

The product commands must work without reading a parent path, root PRD,
development skill, root workflow, or development transaction history.

## Status boundary

The repository is a non-production reboot candidate. Structural validation does
not establish stakeholder acceptance, domain truth, production readiness, or
operational authority. Those require separate evidence and accountable human
decisions.
