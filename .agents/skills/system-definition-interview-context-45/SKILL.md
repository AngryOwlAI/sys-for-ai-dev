# System Definition Interview Context 45 - sys-for-ai-dev Runtime Adaptation

## sys-for-ai-dev Authority Rules

- Root PRDs, implementation plans, source registries, validators, and git-tracked files outrank generated outputs.
- `sys-for-ai/` is the product scaffold being developed; it is not the full development workspace.
- `.agents/skills/<skill-id>/` is the active runtime skill surface for this repository.
- `.codex/skills/<skill-id>/SKILL.md` is compatibility-only and must point back to this canonical path.
- Existing `sys-for-ai/skills/core/` files are scaffold and product-reference adapters, not the active runtime authority.
- Do not import local receipts, caches, generated `usage-metrics.txt`, or private operational state as skill source.
- Treat generated PRDs, plans, diagrams, warnings, and handoffs as derivative work until accepted by the relevant project authority.

The imported source guidance below remains valid where it does not conflict with these sys-for-ai-dev rules.

description: Interview stakeholders to establish or reconstruct system intent with a 45 percent context-used checkpoint, saving temp_prd.md for resumable system-definition discovery when context is low or metrics are unavailable.

# system-definition-interview-context-45

## Purpose

Provide the long-session variant of `system-definition-interview`.

This skill preserves the same elicitation workflow and
`requirements-discovery-record.md` output, then adds a context checkpoint after
each user answer. When context used reaches 45 percent, context left is 55
percent or lower, or metrics cannot be collected, write a resumable
`temp_prd.md` in this skill folder and instruct the user to continue with
`/system-definition-interview-context-45 temp_prd`.

## When To Use

- The user wants to establish or reconstruct a system and the interview may run
  across multiple discussions.
- The system definition needs stakeholder, boundary, scenario, requirements,
  driver, interface, evidence, and V&V discovery before document generation.
- A prior `temp_prd.md` should be used to resume system-definition discovery.
- Context-aware continuation is more important than finishing in one session.

Do not use this skill to generate final formal documents directly. Route to a
downstream PRD, requirements-analysis, or systems-document skill after the
discovery record is coherent enough.

## Inputs

- User prompt, stakeholder notes, interview transcript, source summary, or
  prior `temp_prd.md`.
- Optional <PROJECT_ROOT> and repository evidence for existing or partially
  built systems.
- Optional <PROJECT_AUTHORITY>, source hierarchy, glossary, ADRs, standards, or
  existing documents.
- Optional <OUTPUT_DIRECTORY> for `requirements-discovery-record.md`.
- `<SKILLS_ROOT>` containing `codex-usage-metrics`.
- `<TARGET_SKILL_PATH>` for this skill folder.

## Outputs

- `<OUTPUT_DIRECTORY>/requirements-discovery-record.md`, unless the user asks
  for chat-only output or a different path.
- A `System Intent Profile` and traceable discovery entries using stable IDs.
- `usage-metrics.txt` in this skill folder after each context check.
- `temp_prd.md` in this skill folder when context used is `>= 45%`, context
  left is `<= 55%`, or metrics cannot be collected.
- A resume instruction using `/system-definition-interview-context-45 temp_prd`.

## Procedure

1. If invoked with `temp_prd`, read `<TARGET_SKILL_PATH>/temp_prd.md` first.
   If it is missing, state that no continuation file was found and proceed from
   the current user prompt.
2. Initialize or refresh the working context: objective, situation
   classification, System Intent Profile, stakeholders, boundary, as-is state,
   to-be state, scenarios, candidate requirements, quality attributes, drivers,
   interfaces, V&V seeds, evidence, assumptions, risks, open questions, last
   exchange, and recommended next branch.
3. Follow the `system-definition-interview` elicitation procedure. Inspect
   available repository or document evidence before asking questions that local
   evidence can answer.
4. Ask one focused question at a time when the answer changes scope, boundary,
   requirement meaning, or stakeholder priority. Use compact batches only for
   independent factual data.
5. After the user answers, record the answer in the working context and update
   the discovery record or chat summary.
6. Run the context metrics checkpoint:

   ```sh
   python3 <SKILLS_ROOT>/codex-usage-metrics/scripts/collect_usage_metrics.py \
     --output <TARGET_SKILL_PATH>/usage-metrics.txt
   ```

7. Read `<TARGET_SKILL_PATH>/usage-metrics.txt` and inspect the `Context`
   section. Continue only when context left is known and greater than `55%`.
8. If context left is `<= 55%`, context used is therefore `>= 45%`. Write
   `<TARGET_SKILL_PATH>/temp_prd.md`, overwriting any previous file only after
   integrating still-relevant prior content, then tell the user:

   ```text
   The discussion has been saved to temp_prd.md. Please start a new discussion
   with /system-definition-interview-context-45 temp_prd so the system-definition
   interview can continue with the saved context.
   ```

9. If metrics cannot be collected, the metrics receipt is missing, or context
   left is unknown, fail closed: write the best available `temp_prd.md`, explain
   that metrics were unavailable, and give the same resume instruction.
10. When discovery is coherent enough, stop the interview loop and route
    unresolved material:
    - Use `decision-grilling-context-45` for unresolved design or scope
      decisions.
    - Use `domain-grilling-with-docs-context-45` for terminology, glossary,
      documentation, or ADR-worthy conflicts.
    - Use `conversation-to-prd` only when product requirements are ready to
      synthesize.
    - Use a future requirements-analysis or systems-document package skill for
      Mission Need, Charter, ConOps, SRD/SyRS, Architecture, SEMP, or V&V Plan
      generation.

## `temp_prd.md` Requirements

When writing `temp_prd.md`, include these sections:

```md
# Temp PRD - system-definition-interview-context-45

## Resume Command

`/system-definition-interview-context-45 temp_prd`

## Objective

## Situation Classification

## System Intent Profile

## Stakeholders And Roles

## System Boundary

## As-Is State

## To-Be State

## Operational Scenarios And ConOps Seeds

## Candidate Requirements

## Quality Attribute Candidates

## Architecture Drivers

## Interface Candidates

## Verification And Validation Seeds

## Evidence Register

## Assumptions, Risks, And Constraints

## Open Questions

## Last Exchange

### Last Question Asked

### User Answer

## Recommended Next Branch

## Metrics Snapshot

## Prior Temp PRD Integration
```

If the session was resumed from an earlier `temp_prd.md`, merge prior content
into the new file. Keep current trace IDs, preserve unresolved questions that
still matter, remove duplicates, and do not append the old file verbatim unless
the prior content cannot be safely merged.

## Validation

- The interview establishes system intent before document generation.
- The metrics checkpoint runs after each user answer.
- `temp_prd.md` contains the last question and the user's answer.
- Resumed sessions integrate prior context instead of discarding it.
- Candidate requirements remain candidates until target-project authority
  baselines them.
- Stakeholders, boundaries, scenarios, candidates, drivers, interfaces, V&V
  seeds, evidence, and open questions remain traceable.

## Failure Modes

- Continuing the interview when context metrics are unavailable.
- Checking context before the user answer is captured.
- Overwriting `temp_prd.md` without integrating prior resumable context.
- Turning elicitation into a large questionnaire instead of a focused interview.
- Generating formal systems documents before intent and boundary are stable.
- Treating candidate requirements as approved requirements.

## Provenance

Created from repository gap analysis as a reusable template. It was not copied
from a project-specific source. Project-bound names, paths, assumptions, and
sensitive operational details were excluded or replaced with parameters.

## Adaptation Guide

When adapting this skill to a specific project:

- Replace placeholders with project-specific paths, commands, authorities, and
  output locations.
- Define how the target project resolves `<SKILLS_ROOT>` and
  `<TARGET_SKILL_PATH>`.
- Add project-specific validation commands and authority hierarchy.
- Decide whether `requirements-discovery-record.md` is advisory, draft
  authority, or controlled project authority.
- Preserve the 45 percent context-used checkpoint unless the target project
  explicitly chooses a different threshold.
- Document any project-specific assumptions introduced during adaptation.
