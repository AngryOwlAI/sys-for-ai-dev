# Domain Grilling With Docs Context 45 - sys-for-ai-dev Runtime Adaptation

Canonical skill ID: `domain-grilling-with-docs-context-45`  
Canonical runtime path: `.agents/skills/domain-grilling-with-docs-context-45`  
Compatibility shim path: `.codex/skills/domain-grilling-with-docs-context-45/SKILL.md`  
Source import: `skills/domain-grilling-with-docs-context-45` from `/Volumes/P-SSD/AngryOwl/ai-skills-for-sys`

## sys-for-ai-dev Authority Rules

- Root PRDs, implementation plans, source registries, validators, and git-tracked files outrank generated outputs.
- `sys-for-ai/` is the product scaffold being developed; it is not the full development workspace.
- `.agents/skills/<skill-id>/` is the active runtime skill surface for this repository.
- `.codex/skills/<skill-id>/SKILL.md` is compatibility-only and must point back to this canonical path.
- Existing `sys-for-ai/skills/core/` files are scaffold and product-reference adapters, not the active runtime authority.
- Do not import local receipts, caches, generated `usage-metrics.txt`, or private operational state as skill source.
- Treat generated PRDs, plans, diagrams, warnings, and handoffs as derivative work until accepted by the relevant project authority.

The imported source guidance below remains valid where it does not conflict with these sys-for-ai-dev rules.

# domain-grilling-with-docs-context-45

## Purpose

Provide a reusable workflow for clarifying domain terminology, surfacing
contradictions between plans and code, and recording stable glossary or
architecture decisions while protecting long interviews from exhausting the
Codex context window.

This variant preserves the documentation-aware one-question loop from
`domain-grilling-with-docs` and adds a context checkpoint after each user
answer. When context used reaches 45% or more of the available window, the skill
writes a resumable `temp_prd.md` in this skill folder and instructs the user to
continue in a new discussion with the `temp_prd` parameter.

## When To Use

- The user wants a grilling session grounded in existing docs or domain language
  and the interview may run long.
- Terms are overloaded, fuzzy, or inconsistent with the project glossary.
- A decision may warrant an ADR because it is hard to reverse, surprising, and tradeoff-heavy.
- A prior `temp_prd.md` should be used to resume a multi-discussion
  documentation-aware grilling session.

## Inputs

- The plan or design under review.
- <CONTEXT_FILE> or <CONTEXT_MAP> when present.
- <ADR_DIRECTORY> when present.
- `templates/context-format.md` and `templates/adr-format.md` from this skill
  package, unless the target project provides a local replacement.
- Repository code and tests for evidence checks.
- Optional `temp_prd` parameter, meaning read this skill folder's
  `temp_prd.md` before asking the next question.
- `<SKILLS_ROOT>` containing `codex-usage-metrics`.
- `<TARGET_SKILL_PATH>` for this skill folder.

## Outputs

- Sequential questions with recommendations.
- Updated glossary/context entries when terms are resolved.
- Optional ADRs for qualifying decisions.
- `usage-metrics.txt` in this skill folder after each context check.
- `temp_prd.md` in this skill folder when context used is `>= 45%`, context
  left is `<= 55%`, or metrics cannot be collected.
- A resume instruction using `/domain-grilling-with-docs-context-45 temp_prd`.

## Procedure

1. If invoked with `temp_prd`, read `<TARGET_SKILL_PATH>/temp_prd.md` first.
   If it is missing, state that no continuation file was found and proceed from
   the current user prompt.
2. Initialize or refresh the working context: objective, discussion summary,
   gathered requirements, confirmed decisions, constraints, risks, unresolved
   questions, terminology decisions, glossary/context updates, ADR candidates,
   documentation evidence, the last exchange, and the next recommended branch.
3. Discover whether the repository uses one context file or a context map with multiple bounded contexts.
4. Use `templates/context-format.md` as the default glossary format unless the
   target project has already defined a local format.
5. Use `templates/adr-format.md` as the default ADR format unless the target
   project has already defined a local format.
6. Create glossary or ADR files lazily only when there is settled content to record.
7. When the user uses a conflicting term, surface the conflict immediately.
8. Use concrete scenarios and code inspection to test boundaries between concepts.
9. Ask exactly one focused question and include a recommended answer.
10. Wait for the user before moving to the next branch.
11. After the user answers, record the answer in the working context.
12. Update <CONTEXT_FILE> inline when a term is resolved, keeping it free of implementation details.
13. Offer an ADR only when the decision is hard to reverse, surprising without context, and based on a real tradeoff.
14. Run the context metrics checkpoint:

   ```sh
   python3 <SKILLS_ROOT>/codex-usage-metrics/scripts/collect_usage_metrics.py \
     --output <TARGET_SKILL_PATH>/usage-metrics.txt
   ```

15. Read `<TARGET_SKILL_PATH>/usage-metrics.txt` and inspect the `Context`
    section. Continue only when the context-left value is known and greater than
    `55%`.
16. If context left is `<= 55%`, context used is therefore `>= 45%`. Write
    `<TARGET_SKILL_PATH>/temp_prd.md`, overwriting any previous file, then tell
    the user:

    ```text
    The discussion has been saved to temp_prd.md. Please start a new discussion
    with /domain-grilling-with-docs-context-45 temp_prd so the grilling can
    continue with the saved context.
    ```

17. If metrics cannot be collected, the metrics receipt is missing, or the
    context-left value is unknown, fail closed: write the best available
    `temp_prd.md`, explain that metrics were unavailable, and give the same
    resume instruction.
18. When enough information has been gathered, stop the grilling loop and
    recommend using `/conversation-to-prd` to create the final PRD. Do not create
    the final PRD automatically unless the user asks.

## `temp_prd.md` Requirements

When writing `temp_prd.md`, include these sections:

```md
# Temp PRD - domain-grilling-with-docs-context-45

## Resume Command

`/domain-grilling-with-docs-context-45 temp_prd`

## Objective

## Discussion Summary

## Requirements Gathered

## Confirmed Decisions

## Constraints

## Risks

## Unresolved Questions

## Domain Terminology

## Glossary Or Context Updates

## ADR Candidates

## Terminology Conflicts

## Documentation Evidence

## Last Exchange

### Last Question Asked

### User Answer

## Recommended Next Branch

## Metrics Snapshot

## Prior Temp PRD Integration
```

If the session was resumed from an earlier `temp_prd.md`, merge prior content
into the new file. Keep current requirements and decisions, preserve unresolved
questions that still matter, carry forward relevant terminology and ADR context,
remove duplicates, and do not append the old file verbatim unless the prior
content cannot be safely merged.

## Validation

- Glossary entries define domain language, not implementation details.
- ADRs are used sparingly and explain the tradeoff.
- Code contradictions are reported with evidence.
- Questions remain one at a time.
- The metrics checkpoint runs after each user answer.
- `temp_prd.md` contains the last question and the user's answer.
- Resumed sessions integrate prior requirements, terminology, and ADR context
  instead of discarding it.

## Failure Modes

- Turning the glossary into a spec or scratchpad.
- Creating ADRs for obvious or reversible choices.
- Accepting user terminology that contradicts existing project language without resolving it.
- Checking context before the user answer is captured.
- Continuing the loop when context metrics are unavailable.
- Overwriting `temp_prd.md` without integrating the prior resumable context.

## Provenance

Derived from a project-specific skill and generalized as a reusable template.
Original project-specific names, paths, assumptions, and private operational
details were removed or replaced with parameters.

## Adaptation Guide

- Replace placeholders with project-specific paths, commands, and authorities.
- Add project-specific validation commands.
- Add domain-specific constraints only when they are required.
- Define how the target project resolves `<SKILLS_ROOT>` and
  `<TARGET_SKILL_PATH>`.
- Preserve the 45% context-used checkpoint unless the target project explicitly
  chooses a different threshold.
- Preserve the reusable procedure unless local evidence shows a better structure.
- Document any project-specific assumptions introduced during adaptation.
