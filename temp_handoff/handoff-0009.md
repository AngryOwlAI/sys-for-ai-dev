# Handoff 0009: Phase 8 Generated Derivative Generators

Date: 2026-07-06
Plan: `implementation_plans/Sys4AI-dev_memory_continue_self_hosting_implementation_plan.md`
Completed phase: Phase 8 - Generated derivative generators

## Latest prior handoff check

Before Phase 8 began, the latest handoff was `temp_handoff/handoff-0008.md`. It recommended implementing generated derivative generators for the Configuration and Control Wiki and Validation Contracts Catalog.

## Work completed

- Added the `sys_for_ai.derivatives` package.
- Added shared generated page helpers in `sys_for_ai.derivatives.templates`.
- Added deterministic Configuration and Control Wiki generation in `sys_for_ai.derivatives.config_control_wiki`.
- Added deterministic Validation Contracts Catalog generation in `sys_for_ai.derivatives.validation_contracts_catalog`.
- Replaced stub-only generated derivative validation with exact deterministic output checks.
- Added CLI support for:
  - `generate-config-control-wiki --check`
  - `generate-config-control-wiki --write`
  - `generate-validation-contracts-catalog --check`
  - `generate-validation-contracts-catalog --write`
- Rewrote generated pages under:
  - `docs/generated/configuration_control/`
  - `docs/generated/validation_contracts/`
- Updated derivative registry rows from `phase1_stub` to deterministic generator IDs and timestamps.
- Added `AJ-P1-DERIVATIVE-GENERATORS-001` to authorize Phase 8 generator and generated page changes.
- Updated boundary validation targets to use the Phase 8 AgentJob.
- Added tests for generated derivative validation, drift detection, and write-mode repair.
- Updated source and control registries for the Phase 8 AgentJob, generator modules, and tests.

## Validation evidence

The following commands passed:

- `cd Sys4AI && .venv/bin/python -m sys_for_ai.cli generate-config-control-wiki --write`
- `cd Sys4AI && .venv/bin/python -m sys_for_ai.cli generate-validation-contracts-catalog --write`
- `cd Sys4AI && make generate-config-control-wiki generate-validation-contracts-catalog validate-generated-derivatives`
- `cd Sys4AI && make validate-agentjob-boundaries validate-check-diff`
- `cd Sys4AI && .venv/bin/python -m unittest discover -s tests`
- `cd Sys4AI && make validate`
- `git diff --check`

Observed behavior:

- Check mode reports all five generated pages as current.
- Write mode deterministically rewrites drifted generated pages in unit tests.
- Generated pages include noncanonical authority notices and `page_metadata` blocks.
- Generated pages include registry/source trace and validation-contract trace.
- Validation Contracts Catalog pages include a structural-versus-semantic warning.
- Boundary validation authorizes generated page changes through `generated_paths` on `AJ-P1-DERIVATIVE-GENERATORS-001`.

## Remaining uncertainty

The generators now produce deterministic Markdown reader surfaces, but Phase 9 still needs the active `.agents` skills, `.codex` compatibility shims, and product scaffold skill documentation for `/continue` and source-first memory.

## Next logical step

Implement Phase 9: skill surfaces and documentation for `/continue` and source-first memory.
