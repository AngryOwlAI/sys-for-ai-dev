# Handoff 0004: Phase 3 Memory Catalog and Lookup

Date: 2026-07-06
Plan: `implementation_plans/Sys4AI-dev_memory_continue_self_hosting_implementation_plan.md`
Completed phase: Phase 3 - Memory catalog and lookup

## Latest prior handoff check

Before Phase 3 began, the latest handoff was `temp_handoff/handoff-0003.md`. It recommended implementing deterministic source-first memory catalog, lookup, status, search, and hash support.

## Work completed

- Converted `sys_for_ai.memory` from a single module into a package while preserving the existing `bootstrap_registries` import contract.
- Added memory dataclasses for registry, validation, derivative, object, and hit evidence.
- Added registry-backed catalog loading across source, control, config, validation-contract, derivative, skill, and operational registries.
- Added authority classification and required-next-action routing.
- Added deterministic memory lookup by ID or path.
- Added deterministic text search over registered text artifacts.
- Added hash-path, validate-hashes, and update-hashes support.
- Added CLI commands under `python -m sys_for_ai.cli memory ...`.
- Added focused unit tests for lookup, status, and search behavior.

## Validation evidence

The following commands passed:

- `cd Sys4AI && .venv/bin/python -m sys_for_ai.cli memory status --json`
- `cd Sys4AI && .venv/bin/python -m sys_for_ai.cli memory lookup SRC-PRD-P0 --json`
- `cd Sys4AI && .venv/bin/python -m sys_for_ai.cli memory search "source-first memory" --limit 5 --json`
- `cd Sys4AI && .venv/bin/python -m unittest discover -s tests`
- `cd Sys4AI && make validate`
- `git diff --check`

The same memory commands failed under system Python because PyYAML is not installed there. This confirms the existing project-local validation boundary: use `Sys4AI/.venv/bin/python` or Makefile targets for scaffold commands.

## Remaining uncertainty

Phase 3 does not write memory preflight receipts. That belongs to Phase 4.

## Next logical step

Implement Phase 4: memory preflight receipt creation, validation, and CLI support.
