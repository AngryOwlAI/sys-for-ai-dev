# Handoff 0006: Phase 5 Continue Packet Kernel

Date: 2026-07-06
Plan: `implementation_plans/Sys4AI-dev_memory_continue_self_hosting_implementation_plan.md`
Completed phase: Phase 5 - `/continue` packet kernel

## Latest prior handoff check

Before Phase 5 began, the latest handoff was `temp_handoff/handoff-0005.md`. It recommended implementing `/continue` status, preflight, selection, and execution-packet kernel.

## Work completed

- Added the `sys_for_ai.control_loop` package.
- Added program-state loading and status payload generation.
- Added Director decision loading.
- Added AgentJob loading and one-AgentJob selection.
- Added execution-packet generation.
- Added minimal handoff helpers for next-AgentJob selection.
- Added one-active-AgentJob and control-loop validators.
- Added top-level CLI commands:
  - `continue-status`
  - `continue-preflight`
  - `continue-select`
  - `continue-packet`
  - `validate-one-active-agentjob`
  - `validate-control-loop`
- Added Makefile targets for the new continue commands.
- Added `DDR-P1-SELFHOST-001` as the active Director decision.
- Added `AJ-P1-SELFHOST-CONTINUE-KERNEL-001` as the pending operational AgentJob selected by the Director decision.
- Updated `program_state.yaml` to reference the active Director decision and latest preflight receipt.
- Registered new control-loop code and control records.
- Added unit tests for program state and continue packet behavior.

## Validation evidence

The following commands passed:

- `cd Sys4AI && make continue-status continue-preflight continue-select continue-packet`
- `cd Sys4AI && make validate-one-active-agentjob validate-control-loop`
- `cd Sys4AI && .venv/bin/python -m unittest discover -s tests`
- `cd Sys4AI && make validate`
- `git diff --check`

Observed packet behavior:

- `continue-status` returned `READY` for `SFA-PROGRAM-STATE-001`.
- `continue-select` selected `AJ-P1-SELFHOST-CONTINUE-KERNEL-001` through `DDR-P1-SELFHOST-001`.
- `continue-packet` emitted an `execution_packet` with role `control_loop_engineer`.
- Unit tests cover missing Director decision blocking and multiple-active-AgentJob conflict.

## Remaining uncertainty

The Phase 5 kernel emits packets but does not finalize AgentJobs, write completion receipts, update handoff chains, or write state snapshots. That belongs to Phase 6.

## Next logical step

Implement Phase 6: completion receipt, handoff, state snapshot, and finalization support.
