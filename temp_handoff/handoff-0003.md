# Handoff 0003: Phase 2 Operational Schemas and Registries

Date: 2026-07-06
Plan: `implementation_plans/Sys4AI-dev_memory_continue_self_hosting_implementation_plan.md`
Completed phase: Phase 2 - Operational schemas and registries

## Latest prior handoff check

Before Phase 2 began, the latest handoff was `temp_handoff/handoff-0002.md`. It recommended implementing operational schemas and registries for Director decisions, AgentJob v0.2 records, handoffs, completion receipts, and memory preflight receipts.

## Work completed

- Added JSON Schema contracts for:
  - Director Decision Records
  - AgentJob v0.2 records
  - handoff v0.2 records
  - completion receipt v0.2 records
  - memory preflight receipts
  - the five new operational registry row types
- Added operational registries for AgentJobs, Director decisions, handoffs, completion receipts, and memory preflight receipts.
- Added empty operational control-record directories for future records.
- Registered new operational registries and contracts in `source_registry.csv` and `validation_contract_registry.csv`.
- Extended registry header and row-contract validation to cover new operational registries.
- Added CLI commands for Director decision validation, operational registry validation, and operational receipt/handoff validation.
- Added Makefile targets for the new validation commands.
- Preserved legacy AgentJob validation while adding auto-detected AgentJob v0.2 validation.

## Validation evidence

The following commands passed:

- `cd Sys4AI && make validate-jsonschema-contracts`
- `cd Sys4AI && make validate-agentjob-registry validate-director-decision-registry validate-handoff-registry validate-completion-receipt-registry validate-memory-preflight-registry`
- `cd Sys4AI && make validate`
- `git diff --check`

## Remaining uncertainty

The operational registries are intentionally header-only at this phase. Phase 5 and Phase 6 will add active records and examples.

## Next logical step

Implement Phase 3: deterministic source-first memory catalog, lookup, status, search, and hash support.
