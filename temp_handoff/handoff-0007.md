# Handoff 0007: Phase 6 Completion and Handoff Finalization

Date: 2026-07-06
Plan: `implementation_plans/Sys4AI-dev_memory_continue_self_hosting_implementation_plan.md`
Completed phase: Phase 6 - Completion and handoff finalization

## Latest prior handoff check

Before Phase 6 began, the latest handoff was `temp_handoff/handoff-0006.md`. It recommended implementing completion receipt, handoff, state snapshot, and finalization support.

## Work completed

- Added `sys_for_ai.control_loop.receipts` for completion receipt loading and next-handoff extraction.
- Added `sys_for_ai.control_loop.finalization` for deterministic `continue-finalize` behavior.
- Extended handoff helpers so handoff paths can be resolved by ID.
- Added CLI support for:
  - `continue-finalize --completion ... --json`
  - `validate-state-snapshots`
- Added Makefile targets for:
  - `continue-finalize`
  - `validate-state-snapshots`
- Added default validation coverage for handoffs, completion receipts, and state snapshots.
- Added root-aware validator checks for completion receipt AgentJob references and state snapshot AgentJob references.
- Added Phase 6 operational records:
  - `Sys4AI/control_records/completions/completion_receipt.example.v0_2.yaml`
  - `Sys4AI/control_records/handoffs/handoff.example.v0_2.yaml`
  - `Sys4AI/control_records/state_snapshots/state_snapshot.example.v0_2.yaml`
- Updated the self-hosting AgentJob allowlist and expected outputs to include Phase 6 finalization artifacts.
- Updated registries for the new completion receipt, handoff, state snapshot, and source records.
- Ran `continue-finalize` against the Phase 6 completion receipt, which updated:
  - `control_records/program_state.yaml`
  - `control_records/state_snapshots/state_snapshot.example.v0_2.yaml`
  - `registries/completion_receipt_registry.csv`
  - `registries/handoff_registry.csv`
- Added unit tests for completion-chain finalization and handoff-chain extraction.

## Validation evidence

The following commands passed:

- `cd Sys4AI && make validate-handoffs validate-completion-receipts validate-state-snapshots`
- `cd Sys4AI && .venv/bin/python -m sys_for_ai.cli continue-finalize --completion control_records/completions/completion_receipt.example.v0_2.yaml --json`
- `cd Sys4AI && .venv/bin/python -m unittest discover -s tests`
- `cd Sys4AI && make validate`
- `git diff --check`

Observed behavior:

- `continue-finalize` returned `FINALIZED` for `RECEIPT-P1-SELFHOST-CONTINUE-KERNEL-001`.
- Program state now records `latest_completion_receipt_id: RECEIPT-P1-SELFHOST-CONTINUE-KERNEL-001`.
- Program state now records `latest_handoff_id: HANDOFF-P1-SELFHOST-CONTINUE-KERNEL-001`.
- `make validate` still reports `continue-status`, `continue-select`, and `continue-packet` as ready.
- Unit tests cover temp-root finalization, state snapshot validation, completion receipt validation, handoff validation, and next-AgentJob extraction.

## Remaining uncertainty

Phase 6 checks receipt-declared changed artifacts against AgentJob allowlists, but it does not yet collect the actual git diff or enforce a commit-range diff boundary. That is explicitly left for Phase 7.

The next handoff recommends `AJ-P1-BOUNDARY-VALIDATORS-001`, but that AgentJob record is not created yet. Phase 7 should create or formalize that bounded validator AgentJob.

## Next logical step

Implement Phase 7: boundary and diff validators for changed artifacts, generated derivative promotion blocking, stale memory evidence, and runtime-skill drift.
