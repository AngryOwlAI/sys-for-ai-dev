# sys-for-ai

`sys-for-ai` is a domain-agnostic system development and management framework for AI agents.

Its purpose is meta-agentic: a root AI agent uses `sys-for-ai` to design, develop, run, improve, and maintain target agentic systems for specific use cases.

Phase 0 defines the product and system-design baseline. Phase 1 initializes the implementation: Python environment, YAML control records, validators, skill adapters, memory registries, and documentation policies.

## Phase 1 setup

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
make doctor
make validate
```

## Useful commands

```bash
make doctor
make validate-agentjob
make validate-skills
make bootstrap-memory
make validate
```

## Authority rule

Canonical sources and registries outrank generated derivatives. Obsidian, wiki, HTML, PDF, diagram, semantic-cache, and index surfaces are reader aids unless explicitly promoted through a source-authority workflow.
