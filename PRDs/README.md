## Canonical And Controlled PRDs

| Source | Status | Current authority |
|---|---|---|
| `PRDs/Sys4AI_phase-0_product_system_design_prd.md` | canonical | Product and system-design baseline for Sys4AI. |
| `PRDs/Sys4AI_phase-1_implementation_initialization_prd.md` | canonical_draft | Phase 1 implementation initialization baseline and scaffold requirements. |
| `PRDs/Sys4AI_phase-2_walking_skeleton_prd.md` | controlled | Accepted Phase 2 walking-skeleton PRD. |
| `PRDs/PRD_decomposition_strategy.md` | controlled strategy | Decomposition and promotion strategy for modular PRD work. |

## Product Identity And Strategic Intent Authority

| Scope | Controlling source or state | Authority rule |
|---|---|---|
| Sys4AI product identity | `PRDs/Sys4AI_phase-0_product_system_design_prd.md`, constrained by accepted `DDR-SFADEV-STRATEGIC-BASELINE-001` | Canonical Phase 0 owns the approved four-object identity and product statement. |
| Sys4AI vision and core values | One controlled candidate location in canonical Phase 0 | The artifact is canonical, but the embedded content approval status remains `candidate` and its strategic requirement lifecycle remains `proposed` until an accountable human principal records `G-08` disposition. |
| Sys4AI complete lifecycle | Accepted normative section in canonical Phase 0 | `DDR-SFADEV-STRATEGIC-BASELINE-G03-001` accepts the eight-stage lifecycle, replacement `SFA-CORE-LIFE-001`, and lifecycle requirements `004` through `008` for implementation. Acceptance does not prove capability or authorize production. |
| Coordination pattern and operational maturity | Separate accepted normative taxonomies and Agentic System Pattern Decision contract in canonical Phase 0 | `G-03` activates the pattern requirements. Pattern describes architecture topology; maturity describes readiness and operating state. Neither field proves the other, and concrete schemas/templates remain blocked until `G-04`. |
| Target-system vision and core values | Separate target strategic-intent artifacts to be introduced by their authorized contract transaction | A target's vision and values must remain separate from Sys4AI product intent and from every other target. USRDs and PRDs reference these artifacts; they do not create competing copies. |
| Historical Phase 0 product direction | `PRDs/Sys4AI_phase-0_prd.md` | Historical provenance only. Useful wording may be migrated into canonical Phase 0 with trace, but the historical file does not regain authority. |
| Derivative PRD modules and generated readers | Registered derivative surfaces | Noncanonical navigation and analysis only; they cannot approve or supersede identity, vision, values, requirements, or permissions. |

Content approval, source authority, validation, requirement lifecycle, capability, evidence freshness, coordination pattern, operational maturity, and lifecycle state are independent dimensions. Canonical location, a selected pattern, prototype evidence, or a passing validator does not imply stakeholder approval, strategic adequacy, implementation, production approval, operational capability, or current evidence. Values never grant permission or override law, mandatory platform policy, safety, security, privacy, compliance, source authority, host/project permissions, or required human approval.

## Historical PRDs

| Source | Status | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `PRDs/Sys4AI_phase-0_prd.md` | historical reference | Superseded Phase 0 reference. Use for historical context only unless a later source-authority decision promotes specific content. |

## Canonical Modules

No PRD module is canonical as of `DDR-SFADEV-25-SUBPRD-PROMOTION-001`.

## Draft Modules

All AJ24 modules remain `draft` and `derivative_draft`. Their WS-25 routing decision is `keep_as_derivative_draft`.

| Module ID | Draft | Authority scope | WS-25 decision |
|---|---|---|---|
| `PRD-MOD-INIT-DISCOVERY` | `PRDs/modules/Sys4AI_init_and_discovery_prd.md` | `init_discovery` | `keep_as_derivative_draft` |
| `PRD-MOD-AGENTJOB-CONTINUE` | `PRDs/modules/Sys4AI_agentjob_and_continue_prd.md` | `agentjob_continue` | `keep_as_derivative_draft` |
| `PRD-MOD-SOURCE-FIRST-MEMORY` | `PRDs/modules/Sys4AI_source_first_memory_prd.md` | `source_first_memory` | `keep_as_derivative_draft` |
| `PRD-MOD-SYSTEM-LAYERS-SELF-HOSTING` | `PRDs/modules/Sys4AI_system_layers_and_self_hosting_prd.md` | `system_layers_self_hosting` | `keep_as_derivative_draft` |
| `PRD-MOD-ROLE-GOVERNANCE` | `PRDs/modules/Sys4AI_role_governance_prd.md` | `role_governance` | `keep_as_derivative_draft` |
| `PRD-MOD-SKILL-LIFECYCLE` | `PRDs/modules/Sys4AI_skill_lifecycle_prd.md` | `skill_lifecycle` | `keep_as_derivative_draft` |
| `PRD-MOD-VALIDATION-TRACEABILITY` | `PRDs/modules/Sys4AI_validation_and_traceability_prd.md` | `validation_traceability` | `keep_as_derivative_draft` |
| `PRD-MOD-TARGET-SYSTEM-GENERATION` | `PRDs/modules/Sys4AI_target_system_generation_prd.md` | `target_system_generation` | `keep_as_derivative_draft` |
| `PRD-MOD-OPERATIONS-MAINTENANCE` | `PRDs/modules/Sys4AI_operations_improvement_maintenance_prd.md` | `operations_improvement_maintenance` | `keep_as_derivative_draft` |
| `PRD-MOD-INTERFACE-INTEGRATION` | `PRDs/modules/Sys4AI_interface_and_integration_prd.md` | `interface_integration` | `keep_as_derivative_draft` |
| `PRD-MOD-SECURITY-SAFETY-ASSURANCE` | `PRDs/modules/Sys4AI_security_safety_assurance_prd.md` | `security_safety_assurance` | `keep_as_derivative_draft` |
| `PRD-MOD-DOMAIN-PACK` | `PRDs/modules/Sys4AI_domain_pack_prd.md` | `domain_pack` | `keep_as_derivative_draft` |

## Conflict Resolution

When sources disagree, use this order:

1. Explicit Director Decision or accepted source-authority migration for the disputed scope.
2. Canonical or controlled PRDs listed above.
3. Controlled registries and validated control records.
4. Derivative draft modules.
5. Generated derivatives and temporary handoffs.

Derivative draft modules are explanatory decomposition views. They do not override
the canonical or controlled PRDs.

## Proposing New Requirements

New requirements should enter as candidate requirements in a requirements discovery
record, PRD draft, or module change proposal. The proposer should include:

- Source evidence or user need.
- A stable candidate requirement ID or proposed requirement prefix.
- A target authority scope.
- Trace evidence paths.
- Known conflicts with existing PRDs or module ownership.

Candidate requirement content remains unapproved and non-active until accepted by the
appropriate source-authority workflow. When a canonical artifact contains an explicitly
controlled candidate section, its canonical artifact status does not promote the
candidate content's approval status or requirement lifecycle.

## Promoting Draft Modules

To promote a draft module:

1. Create a Director Decision that names the module, scope, owned requirement prefixes, and conflict rule.
2. Verify the module has complete normative requirement text, source trace, and validation evidence.
3. Update `Sys4AI/registries/prd_module_registry.csv` from `draft` to the selected canonical status.
4. Update `Sys4AI/registries/requirement_trace_registry.csv` and related source/relationship registries.
5. Run the required validators and close the bounded execution transaction with its authorized closeout and handoff evidence.

Full supersession of the large Phase 0, Phase 1, or Phase 2 PRDs is deferred to a
later migration unless a maintainer explicitly chooses that route.
