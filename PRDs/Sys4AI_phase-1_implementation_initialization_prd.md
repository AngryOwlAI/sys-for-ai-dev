# Sys4AI Phase 1 Implementation Initialization PRD

**Document status:** Draft baseline
**Product name:** `Sys4AI`
**Phase:** Phase 1: Implementation initialization
**Depends on:** `PRDs/Sys4AI_phase-0_product_system_design_prd.md`
**Last updated:** 2026-07-07

---

## 1. Executive summary

Phase 1 initializes the `Sys4AI` implementation repository so development can begin safely, reproducibly, and with source-first governance. Phase 1 does not finish the framework. It creates the first executable spine: Python environment, dependency policy, YAML control records, validators, skill adapters, memory registries, documentation policies, and a Docker decision record.

This revision also initializes the core file-format memory profile spine required by Phase 0: Markdown, CSV, YAML, TOML, and JSON Schema. Phase 1 adds minimal registries, examples, validators, dependency policy, and generated derivative stubs for YAML/TOML configuration-control artifacts and JSON Schema validation contracts. Phase 1 does not build a full wiki engine, does not introduce a vector database, does not make Obsidian canonical, and does not create a standalone JSON wiki by default.

This revision also initializes the discovery-gate, system-layer, self-hosting, role-governance, and skill-lifecycle obligations added to Phase 0. Phase 1 records the first executable registries, templates, validators, and control records needed to keep those concerns auditable without treating discovery candidates as approved requirements.

The default Phase 1 environment is a local Python virtual environment. Docker is deferred unless the environment decision record identifies concrete OS-level dependencies, multi-service orchestration needs, CI parity needs, or target-runtime template needs.

---

## 2. Goals

1. Create a minimal but real Python reference implementation scaffold.
2. Add `PyYAML` and safe YAML parsing as a first dependency.
3. Provide a repo-local `.venv` setup path.
4. Add a Makefile and CLI for validation commands.
5. Create initial YAML examples and schema-like specs.
6. Add source-first memory registries and bootstrap logic.
7. Add all core skill adapter shells from `ai-skills-for-sys`.
8. Add implementation plans and task packets for the next agent pass.
9. Decide whether Docker is needed now, later, or only for generated target systems.
10. Initialize core file-format memory profiles for Markdown, CSV, YAML, TOML, and JSON Schema.
11. Add initial format-profile, configuration-source, control-record, and validation-contract registries.
12. Add TOML configuration examples and parser support.
13. Add JSON Schema validation-contract examples and executable contract validation.
14. Add generated or stub-generated Configuration and Control Wiki pages for registered YAML and TOML artifacts.
15. Add generated or stub-generated Validation Contracts Catalog pages for JSON Schema contracts.
16. Extend Makefile and CLI validation commands to cover format profiles, TOML configuration, JSON Schema contracts, and derivative trace checks.
17. Initialize a Requirements Discovery Record gate before formal USRD generation for new or substantially changed system definitions.
18. Initialize system-layer and self-hosting controls for development-system, framework-product, target-template, target-instance, and derivative-surface work.
19. Initialize controlled role governance, role-to-skill crosswalks, temporary-role policy, and role execution-binding validation.
20. Initialize core skill lifecycle statuses and governed core skill expansion workflow.

## 3. Non-goals

- Do not implement a production runtime service.
- Do not add a vector database.
- Do not build a full generated wiki engine.
- Do not force Docker as the default developer environment.

- Do not treat generated Validation Contracts Catalog pages as canonical.
- Do not support TOML writing or style-preserving TOML editing in Phase 1.
- Do not support secret-bearing YAML or TOML configuration files in Phase 1.
- Do not treat JSON Schema validation as semantic or domain acceptance.
- Do not convert all existing schema-like YAML specs in one step if doing so would destabilize the scaffold.
- Do not treat Requirements Discovery Record candidate requirements as approved or baselined requirements.
- Do not promote product-scaffold skills into active development runtime without a runtime registry decision.
- Do not implement all proposed core organizational skills in this PRD-only integration step.

## 4. Initialization requirements

### 4.1 Repository layout

`SFA-P1-INIT-REPO-001`: Add a Python scaffold under `Sys4AI/sys_for_ai/`.

`SFA-P1-INIT-REPO-002`: Add `Sys4AI/requirements.txt`, `Sys4AI/pyproject.toml`, and `Sys4AI/Makefile`.

`SFA-P1-INIT-REPO-003`: Add folders for `schemas`, `control_records`, `registries`, `skills`, `docs`, and `templates`.

`SFA-P1-INIT-REPO-004`: Preserve top-level PRDs and implementation plans outside the implementation package.

`SFA-P1-INIT-REPO-005`: Add `configs/`, `schemas/contracts/`, `docs/generated/configuration_control/`, and `docs/generated/validation_contracts/` for the initial format-profile scaffold.

### 4.2 Python environment

`SFA-P1-INIT-ENV-001`: Use a local `.venv` as the required Phase 1 development environment.

`SFA-P1-INIT-ENV-002`: Keep `.venv/`, cache files, generated local vaults, and local receipts out of source control unless explicitly promoted.

`SFA-P1-INIT-ENV-003`: Provide setup commands through the Makefile:

```bash
cd Sys4AI
make venv
make install
make doctor
```

`SFA-P1-INIT-ENV-004`: Provide direct interpreter examples:

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m sys_for_ai.cli doctor
.venv/bin/python -m sys_for_ai.cli validate
```

### 4.3 Dependencies

`SFA-P1-INIT-DEP-001`: Add `PyYAML` as the initial required dependency.

`SFA-P1-INIT-DEP-004`: Add JSON Schema validation support through a lightweight Python dependency.

`SFA-P1-INIT-DEP-005`: Add TOML parser support consistent with the supported Python version range. If Python `>=3.10` remains supported, Phase 1 shall add a conditional `tomli` dependency for Python versions below 3.11. If the project raises its minimum Python version to `>=3.11`, Phase 1 may use standard-library `tomllib` without `tomli`.

`SFA-P1-INIT-DEP-006`: Phase 1 shall not add TOML writing, style-preserving TOML editing, vector databases, production memory services, or heavy runtime dependencies for this feature.

`SFA-P1-INIT-YAML-004`: The validation command shall fail on missing required AgentJob fields or malformed skill manifest entries.

`SFA-P1-INIT-YAML-005`: Add handoff, completion receipt, and state snapshot YAML examples that carry source-first format-profile evidence.

`SFA-P1-INIT-YAML-006`: YAML control/state examples shall parse with safe YAML loading and validate against JSON Schema contracts where contracts exist.

### 4.5 Skill import and adaptation

`SFA-P1-INIT-SKILL-001`: Add a `core_skill_manifest.yaml` listing every current core skill from `ai-skills-for-sys`.

`SFA-P1-INIT-SKILL-002`: Add adapter shell folders for each core skill.

`SFA-P1-INIT-SKILL-003`: Each adapter shall include `SKILL.md`, `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and `examples/portable-example.md`.

`SFA-P1-INIT-SKILL-004`: Each adapter shall record source provenance and local adaptation status.

`SFA-P1-INIT-SKILL-005`: Exact upstream content synchronization shall be done by a later explicit import task, not silently.

### 4.6 Memory scaffold

`SFA-P1-INIT-MEM-001`: Add initial CSV registries for sources, derivatives, object relationships, and skills.

`SFA-P1-INIT-MEM-002`: Add a memory bootstrap command that creates missing registries with expected headers.

`SFA-P1-INIT-MEM-008`: Add `validation_contract_registry.csv` for JSON Schema contracts and later validation-contract formats.

`SFA-P1-INIT-MEM-009`: Update source and derivative registries so canonical source files and generated derivative stubs remain distinguishable.

### 4.7 Core format-profile scaffold

`SFA-P1-INIT-FORMAT-001`: Initialize the core file-format profile scaffold without promoting generated derivatives to canonical authority.

`SFA-P1-INIT-FORMAT-002`: Add TOML examples under `configs/examples/` for framework configuration and target-project configuration.

`SFA-P1-INIT-FORMAT-003`: Add JSON Schema contracts under `schemas/contracts/` for initial AgentJob, handoff, completion receipt, state snapshot, TOML configuration, and registry-row structures.

`SFA-P1-INIT-FORMAT-004`: Add policy documents for format profiles, Configuration and Control Wiki behavior, and Validation Contracts Catalog behavior.

`SFA-P1-INIT-FORMAT-005`: Add generated or stub-generated Configuration and Control Wiki pages under `docs/generated/configuration_control/`.

`SFA-P1-INIT-DOCKER-001`: Add an environment decision record that chooses `.venv` as the Phase 1 baseline.

`SFA-P1-INIT-DOCKER-002`: Defer development Docker until a trigger exists: OS-level rendering dependencies, multi-service runtime, strict CI parity, contributor environment drift, or target-runtime generation.

`SFA-P1-INIT-VAL-003`: Validation shall be deterministic and runnable offline after dependencies are installed.

`SFA-P1-INIT-VAL-004`: Add validation commands for format profiles, configuration sources, control records, validation contracts, TOML configuration, JSON Schema contracts, registry graph consistency, generated Configuration and Control Wiki stubs, and generated Validation Contracts Catalog stubs.

`SFA-P1-INIT-VAL-005`: Validation shall fail or warn when governed YAML, TOML, JSON Schema, or CSV artifacts are missing registry rows, reference missing validation contracts, point to missing source files, or appear as generated derivatives with canonical authority.

`SFA-P1-INIT-VAL-006`: Validation shall fail or warn when YAML or TOML examples contain secret-like keys or values according to Phase 1 security policy.

`SFA-P1-INIT-VAL-007`: Validation shall preserve the distinction between structural admissibility and semantic/domain correctness.

`SFA-P1-INIT-VAL-008`: Add a PRD requirement trace validator that checks requirement ID uniqueness and verifies that Phase 0 requirement IDs have explicit Phase 1 coverage, partial coverage, deferral, or not-applicable trace rows with semantic trace classes, justification for partial, deferred, or out-of-phase mappings, and a semantic review verdict for each non-implemented trace row.

`SFA-P1-INIT-VAL-009`: Add a dedicated `make validate-roles` target for controlled role catalogs, role-to-skill crosswalks, execution-binding constraints, generated role Markdown freshness, and role-related proposed skill references. The aggregate `make validate` target shall include `make validate-roles` so role-catalog drift is checked by default.

### 4.10 Discovery Gate Initialization

`SFA-P1-INIT-DISC-001`: Add the Requirements Discovery Record to the artifact catalog, source registry, derivative registry policy, and trace model.

`SFA-P1-INIT-DISC-002`: Add or extend a discovery-record registry that records RDR path, subject system ID, subject layer, producer AgentJob, authority status, candidate requirement count, open question count, downstream USRD link, validation status, source hash, and last validation timestamp.

`SFA-P1-INIT-DISC-003`: Add a sample AgentJob for running `system-definition-interview-context-45` on a new target system or framework-product change.

`SFA-P1-INIT-DISC-004`: Add a sample completion receipt showing RDR creation, validation evidence, open issues, and recommended next route.

`SFA-P1-INIT-DISC-005`: Extend aggregate validation so discovery-record templates and registered discovery records are validated by default.

### 4.11 System-Layer and Self-Hosting Initialization

`SFA-P1-INIT-LAYER-001`: Add a controlled system-layer registry for `development_system`, `framework_product`, `target_system_template`, `target_system_instance`, and `derivative_surface`.

`SFA-P1-INIT-LAYER-002`: Add a self-hosting mode policy document that distinguishes `Sys4AI-dev` active runtime authority from `Sys4AI` product scaffold authority.

`SFA-P1-INIT-LAYER-003`: Add a self-hosting TOML configuration source and register it in `config_source_registry.csv`.

`SFA-P1-INIT-LAYER-004`: Add `validate-system-layers` to verify allowed layer IDs, canonical roots, derivative roots, authority mutation rules, and self-hosting constraints.

`SFA-P1-INIT-CORESKILL-002`: Phase 1 shall add or update a skill-lifecycle validator that checks controlled statuses and rejects active-runtime use of non-active skill packages.

`SFA-P1-INIT-CORESKILL-003`: Phase 1 shall add governed proposal surfaces for core organizational skills and shall distinguish them from project-specific domain packs.

`SFA-P1-INIT-CORESKILL-004`: Phase 1 shall provide minimal scaffold or runtime packages for approved core organizational skills only through controlled AgentJobs.

`SFA-P1-INIT-CORESKILL-005`: Phase 1 aggregate validation shall include skill-lifecycle checks by default after the registry/schema expansion slice creates the required data model.
