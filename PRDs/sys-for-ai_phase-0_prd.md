## 1. Executive summary

`sys-for-ai` is a domain-agnostic system development and management framework for AI agents. It enables a capable AI agent, such as Codex or another AI-harnessed agent, to design, develop, run, improve, and maintain agentic systems for specific use cases across domains such as software engineering, AI, machine learning, physics, mathematics, finance, biology, and other fields. However this project is for now developed within the Codex App AI-harness; therefore, it will leverage the functionality of the Codex App AI-harness.

The central idea is meta-agentic: AI agents use `sys-for-ai` to create and manage other agentic systems. The target output is not merely a document, prompt, repository, or one-off workflow. The target output is a governed agentic system, or a package ready to implement such a system, with defined roles, artifacts, requirements, architecture, verification hooks, operating assumptions, improvement loops, and maintenance obligations.

For Phase 0, an agentic AI software system is treated as a software harness around one or more LLMs, tools, state stores, files, policies, and user-facing interfaces. The harness must include requirements for a bounded control loop, an AgentJob-style execution contract, a source-first memory and knowledge system, source/version-control governance, and derivative documentation surfaces such as generated wikis or reader artifacts.

In Phase 0, `sys-for-ai` establishes the conceptual product definition, role pipeline, artifact contracts, traceability rules, design-phase acceptance criteria, and subsystem requirement baselines. It intentionally stops before implementation initialization. Phase 1 will define how implementation starts, including repository structure, runtime scaffolding, task bootstrapping, tooling choices, and initial executable assets.

## 2. Core product statement

### 2.1 Replacement language

Replace the earlier framing:

> `sys-dev-for-ai` is a domain-agnostic system development framework for AI agents. It helps agents develop, improve, run, and maintain systems across software, engineering, financial, biological, mathematical, physical, AI, ML, and other domains.

With the Phase 0 framing:

> `sys-for-ai` is a domain-agnostic system development and management framework for AI agents. It enables an AI agent to design, develop, run, improve, and maintain agentic systems for specific use cases across domains such as software engineering, AI, machine learning, physics, mathematics, finance, biology, and other fields.

### 2.2 Clarifying interpretation

`sys-for-ai` is not just a general methodology for building arbitrary software systems. It is a framework that an AI agent can apply to produce, operate, and evolve target agentic systems. Those target agentic systems may themselves contain multiple roles, agents, skills, tools, repositories, documents, models, evaluators, runtime procedures, and maintenance policies. In software terms, a target agentic system may be a purpose-specific agentic AI application: a harness that wraps one or more LLMs, tools, state/context stores, controlled skills, and a user interface for a defined job.

For clarity throughout this PRD:

- **Framework system:** `sys-for-ai`, the meta-framework being specified here.
- **Root AI agent:** The AI agent using `sys-for-ai` to perform system development and management.
- **Target agentic system:** The agentic system being designed, developed, run, improved, or maintained by the root AI agent using `sys-for-ai`.
- **Agentic AI software harness:** A software system that wraps LLMs, tools, skills, state, context, policies, and user-facing interaction surfaces for a specific purpose.
- **AgentJob:** A bounded execution contract for one controlled unit of agent work, including role binding, allowed inputs and writes, expected outputs, validators, evidence, and stop conditions.
- **Continuation skill:** A controlled operating procedure, named generically as `/continue`, that resumes from tracked state and advances at most one bounded AgentJob per invocation. Domain-specific systems may alias it, for example as `/continue-research`, but `sys-for-ai` should use the general name.
- **Source-first memory and knowledge system:** A context and knowledge-management system in which canonical sources, registries, and control records outrank generated wiki notes, summaries, semantic caches, local vaults, or other retrieval conveniences.
- **SVC system:** The source/version-control system for controlled artifacts, state, histories, supersession records, and generated derivative boundaries. In Phase 0, `SVC` is interpreted as source/version control unless a project-specific SRP defines a narrower meaning.
- **Domain:** The target problem space for the target agentic system, such as software engineering, ML research, finance, mathematics, physics, biology, or another field.

## 3. Problem statement

AI agents can generate code, plans, prompts, documents, and workflows, but building reliable agentic systems requires more than output generation. A reusable target agentic system needs governed requirements, architecture, role boundaries, artifact contracts, verification methods, improvement loops, and maintenance rules.

Without a framework like `sys-for-ai`, agentic-system development tends to suffer from the following failure modes:

| Failure mode | Description |
|---|---|
| Ambiguous target | The agent builds “a system” without separating the meta-framework from the target agentic system. |
| Prompt sprawl | Roles, prompts, documents, and code emerge without stable contracts or traceability. |
| Weak requirements | User wants are converted directly into implementation guesses without intermediate validation. |
| Poor domain grounding | Specialized constraints in finance, physics, biology, ML, mathematics, or safety-critical engineering are missed. |
| Unclear handoffs | Sub-agents lack precise inputs, outputs, ownership, and exit criteria. |
| Hard maintenance | The resulting agentic system cannot be audited, improved, updated, or safely operated over time. |
| Implementation drift | Code or prompts evolve away from the original user goals and requirements. |
| Unbounded continuation | Agents keep working from stale context, informal chat memory, or vague next steps instead of a controlled state and bounded job. |
| Memory authority inversion | Generated summaries, wiki pages, semantic caches, local vaults, or PDFs are treated as authority instead of navigation back to canonical sources. |
| Derivative drift | Markdown-like wikis, PDF derivatives, TeX views, HTML explainers, or local indexes become stale or inconsistent with their registered sources. |

`sys-for-ai` addresses these issues by giving the root AI agent a controlled lifecycle for turning a user’s desired use case into a target agentic system that can be implemented, run, improved, and maintained.

---

## 4. Product vision

`sys-for-ai` should become a reusable meta-framework that lets an AI agent behave like a disciplined system director for agentic-system development.

The framework should help the root AI agent answer, for any target use case:

1. What agentic system does the user want?
2. Why does the user want it?
3. Which domain constraints matter?
4. Which roles, artifacts, tools, data, interfaces, and runtime processes are required?
5. What requirements must the target agentic system satisfy?
6. How should the target agentic system be architected?
7. What must be verified before implementation, operation, improvement, or maintenance?
8. What should implementation agents such as Codex consume in Phase 1?
9. How will the target agentic system be governed after it exists?
10. What source-first memory and knowledge system does the target agentic system need?
11. What continuation loop resumes work from tracked state without unbounded wandering?
12. What AgentJob contract constrains each unit of agent work?
13. What markdown-like, SVC, wiki, PDF, TeX, or other derivative surfaces are required, and which sources remain authoritative?

## 5. Phase boundary

### 5.1 Phase 0 scope

Phase 0 defines the PRD and system-design baseline for `sys-for-ai`. It covers:

| Area | Phase 0 coverage |
|---|---|
| Product identity | Rename and clarify `sys-for-ai` as a meta-framework for AI agents that build and manage target agentic systems. |
| Concept model | Define root AI agent, target agentic system, domain, sub-agent, artifact, role, and lifecycle. |
| System Design phase | Define the role pipeline, artifact flow, exit gates, and traceability model. |
| Artifact contracts | Define required outputs such as USRD, SRD, ARD, TRP, RSRD, RARD, SRP, run manifest, trace ledger, and issue register. |
| Control-loop requirements | Define Phase 0 obligations for `/continue`, tracked state, handoffs, Director decisions, AgentJobs, completions, validators, and stop conditions. |
| Memory and knowledge requirements | Define source-first context, knowledge, wiki, derivative, registry, and retrieval-surface obligations without selecting implementation tooling. |
| SVC and derivative-surface requirements | Define source/version-control expectations, markdown-like source requirements, generated wiki requirements, and file-type derivative governance. |
| Governance rules | Define universal rules for roles, handoffs, ID schemes, issue handling, and verification hooks. |
| Acceptance criteria | Define what must be true before moving to Phase 1. |

### 5.2 Phase 0 non-scope

Phase 0 does not define the implementation plan in detail. The following belong to Phase 1 or later:

| Out of scope for Phase 0 | Intended future location |
|---|---|
| Repository structure | Phase 1 Implementation Initialization |
| Runtime engine selection | Phase 1 or architecture implementation planning |
| Concrete prompt file layout | Phase 1 |
| CLI, API, package, or service interfaces | Phase 1 or later implementation PRDs |
| CI/CD, deployment, test harness, or observability setup | Phase 1 or later |
| Concrete domain adapter templates | Phase 1 or later domain-pack specifications |
| Production operation procedures | Later Run, Improve, and Maintain phases |
| Concrete memory database, vector index, wiki engine, or retrieval implementation | Phase 1 or later implementation planning |
| Concrete AgentJob schema files, CLI commands, scripts, or validators | Phase 1 Implementation Initialization |
| Concrete SVC provider, branch strategy, commit convention, or repository automation | Phase 1 or later implementation planning |
| Concrete PDF, TeX, HTML, notebook, or other file-type wiki implementation | Phase 1 or domain-pack implementation after Phase 0 requirements determine which surfaces are needed |

---

## 6. Primary users and stakeholders

| Stakeholder | Role in `sys-for-ai` |
|---|---|
| Human user or sponsor | Provides the desired use case, constraints, goals, acceptance expectations, and approval decisions. |

| Codex-like implementation agent | Consumes Phase 0 outputs and later Phase 1 instructions to create or modify repositories, tools, prompts, tests, and runtime assets. |
| System Director sub-agent | Orchestrates phases, role spawning, artifact governance, traceability, gates, and handoffs. |
| Specialist sub-agents | Produce controlled artifacts such as requirements, architecture, technical packages, reconciliation reports, and verification reviews. |
| Domain specialist agent | Validates specialized assumptions, constraints, terminology, metrics, risks, and acceptance evidence. |
| Security, safety, privacy, and compliance reviewer | Reviews risks and controls for sensitive, regulated, autonomous, or high-impact target agentic systems. |
| Maintainer agent | Uses artifacts, logs, issues, and evaluations to keep the target agentic system reliable after implementation. |

## 7. Target use cases

### 7.1 Greenfield target agentic system

A user asks the root AI agent to create a new target agentic system for a specific use case. Examples include:

- A software engineering agent team for issue triage, code changes, review, testing, and release support.
- A mathematical research assistant system for conjecture exploration, proof planning, formalization, and verification.
- An ML experimentation system for literature review, experiment design, training runs, evaluation, and model-card generation.
- A finance analysis system for data ingestion, risk analysis, reporting, and audit evidence.

`sys-for-ai` guides the root AI agent from user intent through requirements, architecture, technical packaging, and implementation readiness.

### 7.2 Brownfield target agentic system improvement

A user already has an agentic system, prompt framework, repository, workflow, or multi-agent process. The root AI agent uses `sys-for-ai` to analyze the current state, preserve what works, identify risks, reconcile requirements, and produce an improvement plan.

### 7.3 Agentic-system operation and maintenance

A user wants a target agentic system that can be operated over time. `sys-for-ai` must capture requirements for monitoring, evaluation, issue handling, safety controls, prompt or tool updates, regression checks, and change control.

### 7.4 Agentic AI software harness

A user wants a purpose-specific software product that wraps one or more LLMs, tools, knowledge sources, and user-facing interaction flows. Examples include:

- A local or web UI that lets a user run a governed agent team against a repository, document set, research problem, or business workflow.
- A tool-using assistant that records its state, work boundaries, completions, and handoffs so work can resume safely.
- A domain-specific agent application that maintains its own source-first knowledge base, generated wiki, and audit trail.

`sys-for-ai` must require the Phase 0 SRP to define the harness boundary, the user interface responsibilities, the tool and memory boundaries, and the control-loop expectations.

### 7.5 Domain-specialized agentic system

A target agentic system must operate in a domain with specialized constraints. For example:

| Domain | Example target agentic system | Domain-sensitive concerns |
|---|---|---|
| Software engineering | Codebase maintenance agent team | Repositories, tests, CI, architecture, security, release discipline. |
| AI and ML | Research and evaluation agent system | Dataset lineage, model drift, benchmark validity, reproducibility, safety evaluations. |
| Physics | Simulation planning or literature synthesis agents | Physical validity, units, numerical stability, experimental assumptions. |
| Mathematics | Proof exploration or formalization agents | Definitions, theorem dependencies, proof validity, formal-verifier compatibility. |
| Finance | Risk and reporting agent system | Data lineage, auditability, regulatory constraints, capital risk, decision controls. |
| Biology | Literature, experiment, or pipeline agents | Protocol validity, biological variability, safety, privacy, reproducibility. |

## 8. Conceptual model

    TAS --> RUN[Run, observe, improve, maintain]
    RUN --> CHANGE[Change requests and evidence]
    CHANGE --> D
```

The diagram separates `sys-for-ai` from the target agentic system. `sys-for-ai` is the framework used by the root AI agent. The target agentic system is the system being produced, run, improved, or maintained.

### 8.1 Required target subsystem baselines

Every serious target agentic system should be analyzed as a set of cooperating subsystems. Phase 0 does not implement these subsystems, but it must determine their requirements when the target system is expected to run, improve, or be maintained over time.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    TAS[Target agentic system] --> UI[User interface and interaction surface]
    TAS --> LLM[LLM and model layer]
    TAS --> TOOLS[Tool and external action layer]
    TAS --> LOOP[Control loop: /continue]
    LOOP --> STATE[Tracked state and latest handoff]
    LOOP --> AJ[AgentJob contract]
    LOOP --> COMP[Completion receipts and validators]
    TAS --> MEM[Source-first memory and knowledge system]
    MEM --> SRC[Canonical sources and registries]
    MEM --> WIKI[Generated markdown-like and file-type wikis]
    MEM --> RET[Retrieval surfaces and local caches]
    TAS --> SVC[SVC: source/version control and supersession]
    SVC --> SRC
    SVC --> COMP
```

The key Phase 0 requirement is authority separation. Canonical sources, registries, control records, and approved requirements define truth for the target system. Generated wikis, PDFs, TeX renderings, HTML explainers, semantic extracts, indexes, and local vaults are useful context surfaces, but they must point back to sources before they are used for claims, routing, or implementation authority.

## 9. System Design phase pipeline

Phase 0 preserves the System Design phase pipeline while updating the language so every role is explicitly contributing to the definition of a target agentic system.

## 11. Universal rules for every role

Every role should obey these rules unless the System Director explicitly overrides them.

| Rule | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Trace everything | Every output claim should trace to a source artifact, user statement, assumption, constraint, decision, or open issue. |
| Do not guess silently | Missing thresholds, actors, environments, units, constraints, or acceptance criteria become TBD or TBR items with owner and risk impact. |
| Separate requirement from rationale | The normative requirement says what must be true. Rationale explains why. |
| Use stable IDs | Artifacts, requirements, assumptions, decisions, risks, controls, and verification items must have unique IDs. |
| Prefer measurable acceptance | Every requirement should have a verification method and acceptance criterion before baseline. |
| Keep artifact boundaries clean | USRD captures user wants. SRD captures system obligations. ARD captures architectural response. TRP and SRP capture implementable technical requirements. |
| Clarify framework versus target | Every artifact must make clear whether it describes `sys-for-ai` or the target agentic system. |
| Treat autonomy as a risk dimension | Agent autonomy, tool permissions, memory, data access, and external actions must be explicit where relevant. |
| Preserve phase boundaries | Phase 0 produces implementation readiness, not implementation initialization. |
| Source beats retrieval | Generated memory, wiki notes, local vaults, semantic extracts, summaries, PDFs, HTML, and other derivatives are navigation aids unless explicitly baselined as source artifacts. |
| Verify memory hits | Any retrieved context that influences a requirement, routing decision, claim, AgentJob boundary, or handoff must be checked against a canonical source, registry row, or controlled artifact. |
| Bound continuation | A continuation invocation should advance at most one authorized AgentJob unless the SRP explicitly defines a safer project-specific transaction model. |
| Supersede, do not rewrite | Activated Director decisions, AgentJobs, completion records, handoffs, and baseline artifacts should be corrected through supersession rather than silent historical mutation. |
| Validator success is scoped | A passing validator proves only the defined process or artifact check, not domain truth, scientific validity, business correctness, or safety in production. |

## 19. Universal handoff contract

Every sub-agent should return a handoff block at the end of its artifact.

```yaml

## 20. Spawn-ready role prompt skeleton

Use this pattern when the System Director creates a sub-agent.

```text
You are the <ROLE NAME> for sys-for-ai.

Framework context:
- sys-for-ai is a domain-agnostic system development and management framework for AI agents.
- It enables a root AI agent to design, develop, run, improve, and maintain target agentic systems for specific use cases.

Target agentic system context:
- Name: <TARGET SYSTEM NAME OR TBD>
- Domain: <DOMAIN>
- Use case: <USE CASE>
- Lifecycle stage: <STAGE>

Your mission:
<one-sentence mission>

You are responsible for:
- <task 1>
- <task 2>
- <task 3>

Your inputs are:
- <artifact/version>
- <artifact/version>

Your required output is:
- <artifact name and format>

Rules:
- Preserve traceability from every output item to its source.
- Distinguish sys-for-ai from the target agentic system.
- Do not silently invent missing facts, thresholds, actors, units, constraints, environments, tool permissions, autonomy levels, or acceptance criteria.
- Mark unresolved items as TBD, TBR, or open issues with owner, risk, and recommended resolution.
- Separate normative requirement statements from rationale.
- Include verification method and acceptance criteria wherever the artifact type requires them.
- Do not perform the next role's work except to note downstream recommendations.
- Respect the current phase boundary.
- Treat generated memory, wiki notes, local caches, PDFs, HTML, semantic extracts, and other derivatives as navigation unless the SRP defines them as controlled sources.
- When retrieved memory affects a decision, verify it against a canonical source, registry row, or controlled artifact.
- For continuation or tool-using work, define or consume only the bounded AgentJob authorized for this invocation.

Exit criteria:
- <clear checklist>

Return:
1. The completed artifact.
2. A traceability summary.
3. An assumptions and open-issues register.
4. A handoff block naming the next recommended role.
5. Any control-loop, memory, SVC, or derivative-surface implications discovered while doing the role's assigned work.
```

## 21. Run, improve, and maintain lifecycle coverage

Although Phase 0 stops before implementation initialization, `sys-for-ai` must be designed around the full lifecycle of a target agentic system.

| Lifecycle stage | Meaning | Phase 0 responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| Design | Understand user wants, requirements, architecture, and implementation readiness. | Fully defined in this PRD. |
| Develop | Create prompts, tools, code, tests, configuration, and documentation for the target agentic system. | Prepare Phase 1 handoff requirements. |
| Run | Operate the target agentic system for real tasks. | Capture operational requirements, continuation state, AgentJob boundaries, memory preflight, and validation constraints where known. |
| Improve | Evaluate outputs, detect weaknesses, update prompts, tools, architecture, memory, control loops, documentation surfaces, or policies. | Capture improvement-loop requirements, evidence expectations, and project-system repair boundaries. |
| Maintain | Manage versions, regressions, incidents, dependencies, data, security, context, generated derivatives, SVC history, and domain changes. | Capture maintainability, governance, source authority, supersession, and change-control requirements. |

---

## 22. Domain adapter expectations

A future version of `sys-for-ai` should support domain adapters or domain packs. Phase 0 does not implement them, but it defines expectations they should satisfy.

| Adapter capability | Description |
|---|---|
| Domain vocabulary | Key terms, entities, units, and conceptual distinctions. |
| Domain constraints | Laws, standards, mathematical assumptions, physical limits, regulatory rules, model constraints, or safety limits. |
| Domain artifacts | Papers, repositories, datasets, ledgers, specifications, notebooks, formal proofs, experiment protocols, or policies. |
| Domain verification | Tests, formal checks, simulations, audits, reviews, metrics, reproducibility evidence, or demonstrations. |
| Domain risks | Feasibility, compliance, safety, validity, misuse, uncertainty, and cost risks. |
| Domain specialist prompts | Role instructions for agents that validate domain-specific assumptions and outputs. |
| Domain memory sources | Domain-specific canonical sources, registries, source authority rules, and retrieval limitations. |
| Domain file-type surfaces | Domain-specific wiki or derivative needs such as TeX, PDF, notebooks, datasets, diagrams, images, code, ledgers, or lab records. |
| Domain continuation policy | Domain-specific constraints on `/continue`, AgentJob boundaries, claim promotion, human gates, and validator meaning. |

---

## 23. Verification and acceptance for Phase 0

Phase 0 is acceptable when the following criteria are met:

| ID | Acceptance criterion | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| SFA-P0-AC-001 | The product is named `sys-for-ai` and the former `sys-dev-for-ai` wording is only retained as historical context. | Document inspection. |
| SFA-P0-AC-002 | The PRD clearly states that `sys-for-ai` is a framework for AI agents to create and manage target agentic systems. | Executive summary and core product statement. |
| SFA-P0-AC-003 | The PRD distinguishes `sys-for-ai`, the root AI agent, and the target agentic system. | Glossary and conceptual model. |
| SFA-P0-AC-004 | The System Design phase role pipeline is defined with artifact outputs and gates. | Pipeline diagram and spawn sequence table. |
| SFA-P0-AC-005 | The artifact catalog includes USRD, SRD, ARD, TRP, RSRD, RARD, and SRP. | Artifact catalog. |
| SFA-P0-AC-006 | The PRD includes traceability, issue handling, verification, and handoff rules. | Universal rules, ID scheme, handoff contract. |
| SFA-P0-AC-007 | The PRD supports cross-domain target agentic systems. | Domain coverage and domain adapter expectations. |
| SFA-P0-AC-008 | The PRD explicitly reserves Phase 1 Implementation Initialization for a separate future file. | Phase boundary section and Phase 1 handoff references. |
| SFA-P0-AC-009 | The PRD defines the generic `/continue` control-loop requirement and does not hardcode the research-specific `/continue-research` name. | Functional requirements and CLRA. |
| SFA-P0-AC-010 | The PRD requires AgentJob-style bounded execution for resumable or tool-using target systems. | Functional requirements, CLRA, ID scheme, and handoff contract. |
| SFA-P0-AC-011 | The PRD defines source-first memory and knowledge requirements, including generated wiki and retrieval-surface authority limits. | CKMSRA, universal rules, and functional requirements. |
| SFA-P0-AC-012 | The PRD requires Phase 0 roles to determine markdown-like, SVC, PDF, TeX, HTML, and other derivative/file-type wiki needs before Phase 1 implementation. | SVCDA, domain adapter expectations, and Phase 1 handoff note. |
| SFA-P0-AC-013 | The PRD separates process validation from domain truth or claim acceptance. | Universal rules, CLRA, CKMSRA, and functional requirements. |

## 24. Risks and mitigations

| ID | Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| SFA-P0-RISK-001 | The framework may be confused with the target agentic system. | Agents may produce artifacts at the wrong level. | Require every artifact to distinguish framework context from target agentic system context. |
| SFA-P0-RISK-002 | The framework may become too generic to guide implementation. | Phase 1 agents may lack actionable details. | Preserve artifact contracts, role outputs, ID schemes, and verification hooks. |
| SFA-P0-RISK-003 | AI agents may invent missing domain facts. | Requirements, architecture, or implementation may be unsound. | Use explicit TBD, TBR, assumptions, open issues, and Domain Specialist review. |
| SFA-P0-RISK-004 | Safety and compliance may be bolted on too late. | High-impact target agentic systems may be unsafe or noncompliant. | Include Security, Safety, Privacy, and Compliance Reviewer early when triggers apply. |
| SFA-P0-RISK-005 | Phase boundaries may blur. | Phase 0 could become implementation planning prematurely. | Keep Phase 1 implementation initialization in a separate file. |
| SFA-P0-RISK-006 | Run, improve, and maintain concerns may be under-specified. | Target agentic systems may be difficult to operate after initial build. | Include lifecycle requirements and Runtime and Maintenance Planner hooks. |
| SFA-P0-RISK-007 | Generated memory, wiki notes, semantic caches, or PDFs may be treated as authoritative. | Agents may route, claim, or implement from stale summaries. | Require source-first memory, memory-hit verification, derivative classification, and source registries. |
| SFA-P0-RISK-008 | Continuation may become unbounded or driven by stale chat context. | Agents may perform unauthorized work or lose auditability. | Require `/continue`, tracked state, latest handoff, one bounded AgentJob, completion receipts, and stop conditions. |
| SFA-P0-RISK-009 | Activated control records may be rewritten to fit later work. | Audit trail and accountability may collapse. | Require supersession rather than silent mutation for activated decisions, AgentJobs, completions, and handoffs. |
| SFA-P0-RISK-010 | Phase 0 may over-prescribe AEther-specific mechanisms. | Target systems in other domains may inherit physics-specific workflow assumptions. | Generalize to CLRA, CKMSRA, SVCDA requirements and defer concrete scripts, schemas, and file layouts to Phase 1. |
| SFA-P0-RISK-011 | SVC, markdown-like, PDF, TeX, HTML, or other derivative requirements may be under-specified. | Phase 1 may build incomplete knowledge/documentation infrastructure. | Require Phase 0 roles to classify needed source and derivative surfaces in SRP. |

## 25. Open questions

| ID | Question | Owner | Blocking? | Recommended resolution |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| SFA-P0-ISSUE-001 | What exact repository and package structure should Phase 1 use? | Phase 1 owner | No for Phase 0 | Define in Phase 1 Implementation Initialization. |
| SFA-P0-ISSUE-002 | What runtime substrates should be supported first, such as local CLI, Codex workflow, service runtime, or notebook? | Phase 1 owner | No for Phase 0 | Evaluate during Phase 1 architecture implementation planning. |

| SFA-P0-ISSUE-009 | Should `SVC` be standardized as source/version control across all `sys-for-ai` artifacts? | System Director | No for Phase 0 | Treat as source/version control in Phase 0 and confirm terminology in Phase 1. |
| SFA-P0-ISSUE-010 | What validation checks distinguish process conformance from domain acceptance for each target domain? | Verification owner and Domain Specialist | No for Phase 0 | Define validator taxonomy in Phase 1 or domain-pack specifications. |

## 26. Change log from initial framing

| Change | Rationale |
|---|---|
| Renamed product from `sys-dev-for-ai` to `sys-for-ai`. | The new name better reflects design, development, running, improvement, and maintenance, not development only. |
| Reframed the product as a meta-framework for AI agents. | The core idea is AI agents using the framework to build and manage target agentic systems. |
| Added “target agentic system” terminology. | Prevents confusion between the framework and the systems produced by the framework. |
| Expanded lifecycle from development to design, develop, run, improve, and maintain. | Aligns the product with long-lived agentic-system management. |
| Preserved and adapted the System Design phase role pipeline. | Keeps the useful artifact-driven flow while making the target agentic-system purpose explicit. |
| Added Phase 1 boundary language. | Ensures Implementation Initialization is created later in its own file. |
| Added run, improve, and maintain hooks. | Ensures future phases account for operating and evolving target agentic systems. |
| Added AgentJob and `/continue` control-loop requirements. | Generalizes the AEther-Flow continuation pattern from research-specific `/continue-research` into a domain-neutral continuation requirement. |
| Added source-first memory and knowledge requirements. | Ensures generated wikis, local memory, semantic extracts, PDFs, HTML, and other retrieval surfaces do not override canonical sources or registries. |
| Added SVC and derivative-surface requirements. | Captures the need for markdown-like sources, source/version control, supersession, file-type wikis, and generated derivative governance. |
| Added CLRA, CKMSRA, and SVCDA annex patterns. | Gives Phase 0 roles a place to define requirements while leaving concrete schemas, scripts, and repository layouts to Phase 1. |

---

## 27. Phase 1 handoff note

Phase 1: Implementation Initialization should be generated later in its own file. It should consume this Phase 0 PRD and the final SRP pattern defined here. It should not re-litigate the product identity unless Phase 0 is intentionally revised.

Expected Phase 1 starting concerns include:

- Repository and directory structure.
- Initial file names and artifact templates.
- Prompt and skill packaging.
- Runtime orchestration assumptions.
- Agent invocation model.
- `/continue` command or skill implementation, including tracked state and handoff loading.
- AgentJob, Director decision, execution-role, completion, validator, and handoff schemas.
- Source-first memory and knowledge implementation, including registries, source hashes, query/preflight tooling, and stale-context handling.
- Markdown-like source system, generated wiki/index system, and required file-type derivative surfaces such as PDF, TeX, HTML, notebooks, datasets, diagrams, or domain-specific formats.
- SVC implementation details, supersession mechanics, checkpoint or commit rules, release bundles, and generated-derivative validation.
- Tooling and dependency choices.
- Test and verification harness initialization.
- Documentation and change-control setup.
- Initial task plan for Codex-like implementation agents.
