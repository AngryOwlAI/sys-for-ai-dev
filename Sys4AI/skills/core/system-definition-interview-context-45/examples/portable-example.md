# Portable example for `system-definition-interview-context-45`

## Scenario

A system-definition interview spans multiple sessions. The agent captures user answers, checks context after each answer, and writes `temp_prd.md` only when context used reaches 45 percent, context left is 55 percent or lower, metrics are unavailable or unknown, or the user explicitly requests a handoff.

## Minimal use

1. Confirm AgentJob authorization.
2. On normal invocation without `temp_prd`, run `archive_temp_prd.py --check`; if a prior checkpoint exists, ask before archiving it.
3. When invoked with `temp_prd`, skip the archive preflight and resume from the checkpoint.
4. Ask one focused system-definition question.
5. Record the answer.
6. Run the metrics checkpoint.
7. Continue only if context left is known and greater than 55 percent.
8. Do not create, overwrite, or refresh `temp_prd.md` after each question when context is still safe.
9. If the threshold or metrics failure occurs before questioning is complete, write `temp_prd.md` and stop.
10. When questioning is complete, ask whether to create a PRD with `/conversation-to-prd`.

## Example PRD handoff

```text
Questioning is complete. Should I create a PRD with `/conversation-to-prd` using the current discussion and `temp_prd.md` if it exists?
```

If the user says yes, route the current discussion and any existing
`temp_prd.md` into `/conversation-to-prd`. If the user says no, stop with a
concise summary and next step. Do not create the PRD automatically.

## Example resume command

```text
/system-definition-interview-context-45 temp_prd
```
