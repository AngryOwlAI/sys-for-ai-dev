# System Definition Interview Context 45

## Status

Adapter shell for the core `Sys4AI` skill `system-definition-interview-context-45`.

## Source

- Repository: `https://github.com/AngryOwlAI/ai-skills-for-sys`
- Path: `skills/system-definition-interview-context-45`

## Purpose

Support long-session system-definition interviews with a 45 percent context-used checkpoint and resumable `temp_prd.md` handoff.

This adapter is also the default discovery gate for new or substantially changed
system definitions. It classifies the subject layer, produces or updates the
Requirements Discovery Record, preserves `REQ-CAND-*` and `NFR-CAND-*` labels,
and keeps PRD creation behind explicit user confirmation.

This adapter checks context metrics after each user answer, but it writes
`temp_prd.md` only at the handoff threshold, on unavailable/unknown metrics, or
on explicit user request.

Do not create, overwrite, or refresh `temp_prd.md` after each question when
context is still safe.

When questioning is complete, ask whether to create a PRD with
`/conversation-to-prd` using the current discussion and `temp_prd.md` if it
exists. Do not create the PRD automatically.

## Archive preflight

On normal invocation without `temp_prd`, run
`skills/core/codex-usage-metrics/scripts/archive_temp_prd.py --check` against
this skill folder before starting fresh work. If an existing `temp_prd.md` is
found, ask whether it is from a prior `system-definition-interview-context-45`
run and should be archived. Only after explicit confirmation, run the same
helper with `--confirm-archive`.

Resume invocation with `temp_prd` skips this archive preflight and reads the
existing checkpoint. Confirmed archives use
`archived_temp_prd/temp_prd_date_yyyy-mm-dd-hh-mm-ss.md`.

## Local authority

This adapter is governed by `Sys4AI` AgentJobs, canonical PRDs, source registries, decision records, and validation commands.

The `temp_prd.md` file is resumable context, not canonical authority. Candidate requirements remain candidates until promoted through an authorized source-authority workflow.

The Requirements Discovery Record is controlled discovery evidence, not a
canonical requirements baseline. USRD, PRD, SRD, ARD, TRP, and SRP generation
must wait until the discovery state is coherent enough and the downstream route
is explicitly confirmed.

## Metrics policy

Use `skills/core/codex-usage-metrics/scripts/collect_usage_metrics.py` for local Codex app context metrics. If the script is missing, fails, cannot report usable context-left data, or context left is at most 55 percent, write `temp_prd.md` and stop.

## Adaptation work remaining

1. Compare this adapter shell with the current upstream template.
2. Replace generic placeholders with local paths, validators, and authority boundaries.
3. Add stronger validation for `temp_prd.md` once a discovery-record validator exists.
4. Keep the end-of-questioning PRD handoff prompt synchronized with `SKILL.md`.
5. Update `skills/core_skill_manifest.yaml` and `registries/skill_registry.csv` if status changes.
6. Mark status as `adapted` only after review and validation evidence.
