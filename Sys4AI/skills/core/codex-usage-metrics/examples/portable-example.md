# Portable example for `codex-usage-metrics`

## Scenario

A `Sys4AI` implementation agent receives an AgentJob requiring `runtime_session_accounting` support.

## Minimal use

1. Read the AgentJob objective and allowed files.
2. Confirm the task needs Codex app session metrics, not API billing or generic telemetry.
3. Run `make validate-metrics`.
4. Run the metrics script with an authorized output path.
5. Treat the resulting receipt as point-in-time evidence.
6. If context left is unknown, route the caller to fail-closed handoff behavior.

## Example output shape
