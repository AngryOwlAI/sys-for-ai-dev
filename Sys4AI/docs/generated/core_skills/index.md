## Authority Boundary

Product scaffold skills are reference surfaces. Active runtime authority remains with registered runtime skill surfaces unless separately promoted.

## Allowed Promotion Path

Promotion requires an explicit source-authority decision, registry update, and validation evidence. This generated page is not promoted by generation.
