# Artifact Contracts

This generated page summarizes artifact contracts, producers, consumers, derivative surfaces, and promotion rules.

## Registry Trace

| derivative_id | path | source_ids | generation_method | status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| der_artifact_contracts_index | docs/generated/artifact_contracts/index.md | SRC-REG-ARTIFACT-CONTRACTS;SRC-DERIVATIVE-GENERATION | sys_for_ai.derivative_generation.governance_generated_docs:0.1.0 | generated_derivative |

## Structural Versus Semantic Warning

Validation contracts prove structural conformance only. They do not prove semantic truth, product correctness, or implementation completeness.

## Allowed Promotion Path

Promotion requires an explicit source-authority decision, registry update, and validation evidence. This generated page is not promoted by generation.
