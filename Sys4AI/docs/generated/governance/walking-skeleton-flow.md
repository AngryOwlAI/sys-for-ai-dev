## Scoped Lifecycle Evidence

| stage | inputs | responsible_role | approving_role | permissions | activities | outputs | entry_criteria | exit_criteria | failure_behavior | rollback_or_return | evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Design | validated target RDR, vision, core values, approval or waiver, and host constraints | requirements_manager | accountable human principal | read registered sources; write only controlled target design artifacts | classify the target, resolve intent, select the pattern, and define requirements | pattern decision and product requirements | target and subject layer classified; RDR validated | intent state and pattern decision are explicit and traceable | stop on missing approval, waiver, authority, or required host evidence | return to discovery or candidate intent without promoting authority | target manifest, RDR, strategic-intent artifacts, approval evidence, and pattern decision |
| Develop | controlled requirements, pattern decision, and host limitations | implementation_planner | accountable transaction approval principal | plan only within the declared target and framework write surfaces | define the bounded implementation sequence, validators, stops, and rollback | implementation plan and authorized portable execution transactions | design evidence is current and the implementation boundary is authorized | each transaction binds authority, permissions, validation, and safe stop behavior | leave the transaction unexecuted when authority or capability is absent | supersede the plan or return to Design; do not rewrite activated evidence | implementation plan, package transactions, and TX-16 execution transaction |
| Implement | authorized transactions and current source-backed state | system_engineer | transaction approval principal | execute only declared reads, writes, tools, and external actions | produce the bounded package, flow, trace, and closeout evidence | implementation artifacts, artifact index, and source-backed transition state | permission envelope and required host capabilities are current | implementation artifacts exist and the exact next state is recorded | stop at the nearest safe boundary and retain accepted evidence | revert the bounded packet or supersede it with explicit evidence | artifact index, framework trace, completion receipt, and handoff |
| Test | implementation artifacts and declared acceptance criteria | verification_engineer | accountable acceptance principal for any later promotion | run repository-local checks without expanding target or production authority | separate test execution, requirements verification, stakeholder validation, and evaluation | test, verification, validation, and evaluation evidence with explicit gaps | implemented artifacts and deterministic validators are available | structural checks pass and all unrun semantic, stakeholder, and production evidence remains explicit | fail closed and do not advance flow or maturity | return to Implement for bounded repair or to Design for requirement conflict | test-and-evaluation summary, validation summary, generated flow report, and validator results |

## Distinct Test And Evaluation Evidence

- Test execution: repository-local unit, CLI, and aggregate checks.
- Requirements verification: generalized framework trace plus package-local trace.
- Stakeholder or system validation: not run; framework G-08 is accepted, while target-system validation and domain acceptance remain open.
- Behavioral or performance evaluation: not run; TX-17 and production evidence remain later work.

## Historical Evidence Appendix

Historical packet-era artifacts remain available as activated evidence. They are not active runtime nodes.

## Warnings And Open Gates

- Framework G-07 is accepted for the current mixed reference-host profile; this derivative target package remains permission-dependent and has no target runtime.
- G-08 framework strategic approval is accepted; target-system approval and domain acceptance remain independent.
- Production readiness, operational authority, stakeholder consensus, and domain acceptance remain open.
- Target package evidence is structural and derivative-only.

## Missing Artifacts

- none

## Trace Gaps

- none

## Boundary

Structural validation does not prove strategic quality, ethical correctness, stakeholder consensus, behavioral alignment, production readiness, or domain truth. Those claims require accountable review and additional evidence.

The example remains a derivative smoke package at validated_prototype maturity. Its fictional demonstration approval does not inherit framework G-07 as target-runtime permission and does not establish target-system validation, production readiness, operational authority, stakeholder consensus, or domain acceptance; framework G-08 and the mixed reference-host G-07 profile are independently accepted.
