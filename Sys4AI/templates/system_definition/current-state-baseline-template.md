## 1. Authority Notice

This record is a brownfield discovery artifact. It captures observed repository state, source evidence, assumptions, risks, maintenance goals, migration pressures, and open questions.

This record is not a canonical requirements baseline unless promoted through the project source-authority process. Canonical PRDs, source registries, decision records, approved requirements, and control records outrank this document.

Candidate requirements must remain labeled as `REQ-CAND-*` or `NFR-CAND-*` until promoted by project authority.
